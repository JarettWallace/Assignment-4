For the timed challenge I decided to go with the very first problem on the list, I decided to go with that one in particular as it reminded me of a problem that I had to do for a programming class my freshman year. For the problem presented a list seemed like the best option as the problem presented wanted me to rotate a list of numbers based upon a factor of k, for the example given it wanted k to be 2 spaces. So after thinking back for a short amount of time on what my previous professor had me do in a problem like this I began to write a list structure that would allow them to be rotated right by the k degree I hard coded in the list for this problem as it was not specified if it needed to accept a user input, and doing this also saved me a lot of time rather than allowing for a user to input their own list of numbers. Normally when given much more time I could have made this need a user input to function properly but with the imposed time limits I went back to my basics of what I knew how to do quickly and from the top of my head with as little mistakes as possible.
